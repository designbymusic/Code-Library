OAuth Examples using Twitter

These standalone scripts are meant to be run from the command line,
for learning the OAuth requests and responses.  You are expectd to
edit these scripts (very minimally) to fill in the various tokens and
secrets required as input for each step.

The accompanying tutorial can be found here:
http://nullinfo.wordpress.com/oauth-twitter/

globals.php - edit to fill in the consumer key and secret
oauth_helper.php - helper functions; no editing required
getreqtok.php - no editing required
getacctok.php - edit to fill in the required token, secret, and verifier
tweet.php - edit to fill in the required token and secret

Though the concepts are generic to OAuth, these scripts have been
tweaked to work with Twitter.
